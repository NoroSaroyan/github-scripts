## üìã Coding Standards

### Script Requirements
All new scripts must:

1. **Start with a proper shebang**: `#!/bin/bash`
2. **Include error handling**: Check for required dependencies and validate inputs
3. **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the existing code style
4. **Include user-friendly prompts**: Clear instructions and interactive elements
5. **Handle edge cases**: Validate inputs and provide meaningful error messages

### Code Style Guidelines

```bash
# Good: Clear variable names and proper error checking
if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Error: GitHub CLI (gh) is required but not installed."
    exit 1
fi

# Good: User-friendly prompts with defaults
read -rp "Enter GitHub username: " USERNAME
read -rp "Enter permission level (pull/push/admin), default 'push': " PERM
PERM=${PERM:-push}

# Good: Input validation
if [[ -z "$USERNAME" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Username cannot be empty."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Documentation Requirements

Each new script must include:

1. **Header comment** explaining what the script does
2. **Usage examples** in comments
3. **Dependencies** clearly listed
4. **Error handling** for common failure scenarios

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test your script** with various inputs and edge cases
2. **Verify compatibility** with both macOS and Linux (if applicable)
3. **Check error handling** by providing invalid inputs
4. **Ensure dependencies** are properly checked

### Test Checklist
