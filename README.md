# GitHub Scripts Collection

A comprehensive collection of shell scripts designed to streamline GitHub repository management tasks. These tools leverage the GitHub CLI to automate common operations across multiple repositories.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before using any script in this collection, ensure you have the following installed:

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: [Installation Guide](https://cli.github.com/)
- **jq**: JSON processor for parsing API responses
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install jq
  
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install jq
  
  # Windows (using Chocolatey)
  choco install jq
  ```

## üìã Available Scripts

### üîí Mass Privatize Repositories (`mass-privatize-repos.sh`)

Efficiently convert multiple public repositories to private with an interactive selection interface.

#### Features
- Interactive repository selection with support for individual repos, ranges, or all repos
- Dry-run mode for testing (modify `DRY_RUN=true` in the script)
- Robust error handling and validation
- Real-time progress feedback

#### Usage

1. **Download the script:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoroSaroyan/github-scripts/main/mass-privatize-repos.sh
   chmod +x mass-privatize-repos.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./mass-privatize-repos.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Enter your GitHub username
   - Authenticate with GitHub CLI (if not already logged in)
   - Select repositories using various formats:
     - Single repos: `1,3,5`
     - Ranges: `1-5,8,10-12`
     - All repos: `all`

#### Selection Examples
```
# Make repositories 1, 3, and 5 private
1,3,5

# Make repositories 1 through 5 and repository 8 private
1-5,8

# Make all public repositories private
all
```

#### Safety Features
- Validates repository indices to prevent errors
- Shows repository list before selection
- Confirms each operation with detailed output
- Graceful error handling for failed operations

### üåê Mass Publicize Repositories (`mass-publicize-repos.sh`)

Convert multiple private repositories to public with an intuitive selection interface. Perfect for open-sourcing projects or making repositories publicly accessible.

#### Features
- Interactive repository selection with support for individual repos, ranges, or all repos
- Automatic fetching of all private repositories
- Input validation and error handling
- Real-time progress feedback with detailed status messages

#### Usage

1. **Download the script:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoroSaroyan/github-scripts/main/mass-publicize-repos.sh
   chmod +x mass-publicize-repos.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./mass-publicize-repos.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Enter your GitHub username
   - Authenticate with GitHub CLI (if not already logged in)
   - Select repositories using various formats:
     - Single repos: `1,3,5`
     - Ranges: `1-5,8,10-12`
     - All repos: `all`

#### Selection Examples
```
# Make repositories 1, 3, and 5 public
1,3,5

# Make repositories 1 through 5 and repository 8 public
1-5,8

# Make all private repositories public
all
```

#### Important Notes
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Caution**: Making repositories public exposes all code, commits, and history
- The script automatically accepts visibility change consequences
- Failed operations are clearly reported with error messages
- Only processes private repositories (public repos are filtered out)
